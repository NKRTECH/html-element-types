<h1><STRong>MY HOBBIES</STRong></h1>
<P>I AM INTERESTED IN WESTERN CULTURE. </P>
<P>I AM CURIOUS ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF WESTERN VALUES AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION.</P>
<P>SINCE WESTERN PHILOSOPHY HAD A HUGE ROLE TO PLAY IN EVOLUTION OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND THE WORLD, SO I LIKE TO EXPLORE WESTERN PHILOSOPHY.
</P>
<P>IN MY FREE TIME I MOSTLY WATCH YOUTUBE VIDEOS, 90% CONTENT IN ENGLISH.</P>
<P>IN MY FREE TIME I ALSO USE TO WATCH CAUCASIAN DANCES. </P>
<P><strong>BUT AFTER JOINING KALVIUM</strong> I HAD TO PUT A HALT ON MY HOBBIES <br> <strong>BECAUSE MY BRAIN CAN NOT HANDLE THAT MUCH INTELLECTUAL WORK</strong>
WHICH ARE DOING ASSIGNMENT AND LEARNING PHILOSOPHY SIDE BY SIDE.</P>
<P><strong>SO, NOW I MOSTLY WATCH CAUCASIAN DANCES IN WHATEVER LITTLE FREE TIME I GET.</strong></P>
